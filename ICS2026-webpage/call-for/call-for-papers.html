              <h1 id="ics26-call-for-papers">ICS’26 Call for papers</h1>

<p>The ACM International Conference on Supercomputing serves as the leading international forum for presenting research results in high-performance computing systems. The 40th edition of ICS will be held in Belfast, Northern Ireland (United Kingdom) from July 6th-9th, 2026. ICS 2026 holds two cycles of paper submissions.</p>

<h2 id="important-dates-cycle-1">Important dates (Cycle 1)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Abstract submission: December 9th, 2025</li>
  <li>Paper submission: December 16th, 2025</li>
  <li>Rebuttal period: Feb 10th to Feb 12th, 2026</li>
  <li>Author notification: Feb 24th, 2026</li>
  <li>Camera ready: March 24th, 2026</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="important-dates-cycle-2">Important dates (Cycle 2)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Abstract submission: February 2nd, 2026</li>
  <li>Paper submission: February 9th, 2026</li>
  <li>Rebuttal period: March 24th to March 26th, 2026</li>
  <li>Author notification: April 6th, 2026</li>
  <li>Camera ready: May 6th, 2026</li>
</ul>

<p>Papers are solicited on all aspects of the architecture, software, and applications of high-performance computing systems of all scales (from chips to supercomputing systems), including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Processor, accelerator, memory, storage, interconnect, and system architectures, including architectures based on future and emerging hardware (e.g. quantum, superconducting, photonic, neuromorphic).</li>
  <li>Programming languages, paradigms, and execution models, including domain-specific languages and scientific problem-solving software environments.</li>
  <li>Compilers, runtime systems and system software, including optimization and support for hardware resources and energy management.</li>
  <li>High-performance algorithms and applications including machine learning and large-scale data analytics, as well as the implementation and deployment of algorithms and applications on large-scale systems.</li>
  <li>Tools for measurement, modeling, analysis, and visualization of performance, energy, or other quantitative properties of high-performance computing systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>Papers will be evaluated based on their novelty, technical soundness, and potential impact on the field. 
The review process includes a rebuttal phase, and the committee’s discussions will take the authors’ responses into account. 
A paper cannot be submitted to both cycles.</p>

<p>Accepted papers will be published in the ACM proceedings. Have in mind that <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies">ACM’s publications policies</a> apply to all submitted papers, including ACM’s new <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects">Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects</a>. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper.</p>

<h2 id="important-update-on-acms-new-open-access-publishing-model-for-2026-acm-conferences">Important update on ACMs new open access publishing model for 2026 ACM Conferences!</h2>

<p>Starting January 1, 2026, ACM will fully transition to Open Access. All ACM publications, including those from ACM-sponsored conferences, will be 100% Open Access. Authors will have two primary options for publishing Open Access articles with ACM: the ACM Open institutional model or by paying Article Processing Charges (APCs). With over 1,800 institutions already part of ACM Open, the majority of ACM-sponsored conference papers will not require APCs from authors or conferences (currently, around 70-75%).</p>

<p>Authors from institutions not participating in ACM Open will need to pay an APC to publish their papers, unless they qualify for a financial or discretionary waiver. To find out whether an APC applies to your article, please consult the list of <a href="https://libraries.acm.org/acmopen/open-participants">participating institutions</a> in ACM Open and review the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/policy-on-open-access-apc-waivers-and-discounts">APC Waivers and Discounts Policy</a>. Keep in mind that waivers are rare and are granted based on specific criteria set by ACM.</p>

<p>Understanding that this change could present financial challenges, ACM has approved a temporary subsidy for 2026 to ease the transition and allow more time for institutions to join ACM Open. The subsidy will offer:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$250 APC for ACM/SIG members</li>
  <li>$350 for non-members</li>
</ul>

<p>This represents a <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess">65% discount</a>, funded directly by ACM. Authors are encouraged to help advocate for their institutions to join ACM Open during this transition period.</p>

<p>This temporary subsidized pricing will apply to all conferences scheduled for 2026.</p>

<h2 id="for-authors-who-may-require-a-visa-to-enter-the-united-kingdom">For authors who may require a visa to enter the United Kingdom</h2>

<p>In the case of authors who may require visas to enter the UK to attend the conference, we encourage them to apply for them early (e.g., at submission time). Please, have in mind that in the unfortunate event that authors do not receive visas on time for the conference, they will be required to provide a proof of the pending or rejected visa application. Please see the ICS website TBA for details.</p>
